# Multiple Images Feature Implementation Summary

## Problem Fixed
Previously, when users selected multiple images to post, only one image was displayed in the feed screen. Now all selected images are properly displayed with a carousel/swipe functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Model Updates (`Secret.kt`)
- Added `imageUrls: List<String>?` field to support multiple images
- Kept `imageUrl: String?` for backward compatibility
- Added `imageBase64List: List<String>?` to `CreateSecretRequest` for uploading multiple images

### 2. Feed UI Components (`FeedComponents.kt`)
- Updated `FeedSecretCard` to display multiple images with a carousel
- Added horizontal pager for swiping between images
- Added page counter (e.g., "1/3") in top-right corner
- Added dot indicators at the bottom showing current page
- Single images display as before without pagination UI
- All images are clickable to open full-screen viewer

### 3. New Image Viewer Screen (`ImageViewerScreen.kt`)
- Full-screen image viewing with black background
- Horizontal swipe/pager to navigate between images
- Page counter showing current position (e.g., "1 / 3")
- Dot indicators at bottom for visual navigation
- Back button to return to feed
- Fits images to screen while maintaining aspect ratio

### 4. Navigation Updates
- Added `ImageViewer` to Screen enum
- Added image viewer state variables (`imageViewerUrls`, `imageViewerInitialPage`)
- Wired up navigation from feed → image viewer → back to feed
- Passed `onImageClick` callback through all layers:
  - SecretSpacesApp → MainScreenContainer → FeedScreen → FeedSecretCard

### 5. Feed Screen Updates (`FeedScreen.kt`)
- Added `onImageClick` parameter to handle image clicks
- Passes callback to `FeedSecretCard` component

### 6. MainScreenContainer Updates
- Added `onImageClick` parameter
- Passes callback through to FeedScreen

## User Experience

### Viewing Multiple Images in Feed:
1. Posts with multiple images show in a carousel format
2. Swipe left/right to see all images
3. Page counter shows "2/5" (current/total) in top-right
4. Dot indicators at bottom show position visually
5. Posts with single images display as before (no pagination UI)

### Full-Screen Image Viewer:
1. Tap any image in feed to open full-screen viewer
2. Opens to the exact image you tapped
3. Swipe left/right to view all images
4. Page counter and dots help with navigation
5. Tap back button to return to feed

## UI Design Features
- **Carousel**: Smooth horizontal swipe between images
- **Page Counter**: Semi-transparent badge showing "1/3"
- **Dot Indicators**: White dots at bottom (active is solid, others are transparent)
- **Click to Expand**: Tap any image to view full-screen
- **Black Background**: Full-screen viewer uses black for better focus
- **Gradient Overlay**: Subtle gradient on feed images for better visibility

## Backend Note
The `CreateSecretRequest` now supports `imageBase64List` for uploading multiple images. You'll need to update your backend API to:
1. Accept multiple images in the create secret endpoint
2. Store multiple image URLs in the database
3. Return `imageUrls` array in the API response

The app maintains backward compatibility - it will work with existing posts that only have `imageUrl` set.

## Similar to Facebook/Instagram
- Swipe through multiple photos in a post
- Tap to view full-screen
- Visual indicators showing which photo you're viewing
- Smooth animations and transitions
