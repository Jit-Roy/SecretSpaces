# Testing Rotation and Crop Boundary Fix

## Changes Made
1. Added rotation angle and horizontal flip state to ImageCropScreen
2. Added UI buttons for rotating left (-90°), rotating right (+90°), and flipping horizontally
3. Implemented boundary checking functions to prevent crop frame from extending beyond rotated image bounds:
   - `computeDisplayDims`: Calculate display dimensions based on image aspect ratio
   - `rectCorners`: Get the four corners of a rectangle
   - `isPointInPolygon`: Check if a point is inside a convex polygon (works with both clockwise and counterclockwise winding)
   - `isRectInsideRotatedImage`: Check if crop rectangle is fully within the rotated image bounds
4. Updated CropView to render rotated and flipped images using Canvas transformations
5. Updated drag and resize logic to use boundary checking for rotated images
6. Updated cropBitmapToLandscape to apply rotation and flip before cropping

## Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: No Rotation or Flip (Baseline)
1. Open the app and select an image for cropping
2. Try to drag the crop frame to the edges
3. Verify the crop frame stays within the image bounds
4. Save and verify the cropped image looks correct

### Test 2: Rotation at 90° Increments
1. Load an image
2. Rotate left (90°)
   - Verify the image rotates correctly
   - Try to drag the crop frame to all edges
   - Verify the crop frame cannot extend into the black background
   - Save and verify the cropped image is rotated correctly
3. Rotate right twice (180° total from original)
   - Same checks as above
4. Rotate left (270° total)
   - Same checks as above

### Test 3: Horizontal Flip
1. Load an image
2. Flip horizontally
   - Verify the image flips correctly
   - Try to drag and resize the crop frame
   - Verify the crop frame stays within the flipped image bounds
   - Save and verify the cropped image is flipped correctly

### Test 4: Combination of Rotation and Flip
1. Load an image
2. Rotate right (90°) then flip
   - Verify both transformations are applied correctly
   - Test crop frame boundary checking
   - Save and verify the result
3. Test other combinations (flip then rotate, multiple rotations + flip)

### Test 5: Edge Cases
1. Very narrow/tall images (high aspect ratio)
2. Very wide images (low aspect ratio)
3. Small images that need significant scaling
4. Test with images at 45° angles (if implemented)

### Test 6: Resize and Zoom with Rotation
1. Rotate an image
2. Zoom in on the image (pinch inside crop frame)
3. Resize the crop frame by dragging edges and corners
4. Verify all operations respect the rotated image bounds

## Expected Results
- Crop frame white border should never extend into black background area
- All crop operations (drag, resize) should be constrained to the visible rotated image
- Saved cropped images should not contain any black background
- Image quality should be preserved after rotation and cropping

## Known Limitations
- Crop frame is reset to center when rotation or flip is applied (by design, for simplicity)
- Canvas dimensions are hardcoded in cropBitmapToLandscape (1080x1920) which may not match actual device

## Boundary Checking Algorithm
The implementation uses polygon containment testing:
1. Calculate the four corners of the rotated image in canvas space
2. Transform corners by applying flip (if needed) then rotation
3. For each corner of the crop rectangle, check if it's inside the rotated image polygon
4. Use cross-product method that works with both clockwise and counterclockwise polygon winding
5. If all crop corners are inside the image polygon, the crop is valid
