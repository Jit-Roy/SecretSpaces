# Crop Frame Rotation Fix - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Fixed
The crop frame now stays within the rotated image bounds. No more black background in cropped images!

## New Features
Three new buttons appear below the crop view:
1. **↶ Rotate** - Rotates image 90° left (counterclockwise)
2. **⇄ Flip** - Flips image horizontally
3. **Rotate ↷** - Rotates image 90° right (clockwise)

## How It Works
When you rotate or flip an image:
1. The image displays with the transformation applied
2. The crop frame is constrained to stay within the visible image area
3. You cannot drag or resize the crop frame into the black background
4. The saved cropped image includes the rotation/flip

## Testing Your Images
Try these tests to see it working:

### Test 1: Basic Rotation
1. Load an image
2. Click "Rotate ↷" once (90° rotation)
3. Try to drag the crop frame to the edges
4. Notice: The frame stops at the image boundary!
5. Save and verify the image is rotated correctly

### Test 2: Flip and Rotate
1. Load an image
2. Click "⇄ Flip"
3. Click "Rotate ↷"
4. Drag the crop frame around
5. Verify it stays within bounds
6. Save and check the result

### Test 3: Multiple Rotations
1. Load an image
2. Click "Rotate ↷" four times (full 360°)
3. The image should return to original orientation
4. Crop and save to verify it works correctly

## Technical Details
See these files for more information:
- `SUMMARY.md` - Overview of changes
- `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` - Technical implementation details
- `TESTING_ROTATION_CROP.md` - Comprehensive testing procedures

## What Changed in the Code
File: `app/src/main/java/com/secretspaces32/android/ui/screens/ImageCropScreen.kt`
- Added 4 new helper functions for boundary checking
- Added rotation and flip state management
- Added 3 UI control buttons
- Updated Canvas rendering to support rotation/flip
- Updated drag/resize logic to respect boundaries
- Fixed bitmap cropping to handle transformations correctly

## Implementation Approach
1. **Polygon Containment**: The rotated image bounds form a polygon, and we check if all crop frame corners are inside it
2. **Transformation Order**: Flip first, then rotate (consistent everywhere)
3. **Coordinate Mapping**: Careful handling of canvas space vs bitmap space
4. **Efficient Processing**: Crop original bitmap, then transform the crop (not the whole image)

## Building and Running
The code is ready to build. Use your standard Android build process:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Or open in Android Studio and run normally.

## Expected Behavior After Fix
✅ Crop frame cannot extend into black background
✅ Rotation buttons work (90° increments)
✅ Flip button works
✅ Drag constrained to rotated image
✅ Resize constrained to rotated image
✅ Saved images have correct rotation/flip applied
✅ No black borders in saved images

## Known Behavior (By Design)
- Crop frame resets to center when you rotate or flip (for safety)
- Only 90° rotation increments supported (90°, 180°, 270°)
- Arbitrary angles (like 45°) are not supported

## Troubleshooting
If you see issues:
1. Check that the image loads correctly before rotation
2. Verify the UI buttons appear below the crop view
3. Try a simple 90° rotation first
4. Check the saved image in the gallery
